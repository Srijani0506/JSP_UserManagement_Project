JSP User Management Project
The JSP User Management Project is a web-based application designed to manage user accounts and their roles effectively. Built using Java Server Pages (JSP), Java Servlets, and MySQL, this project allows administrators to perform various user management tasks, including:

User Registration: New users can sign up with their details such as username, email, and phone number.
User Authentication: Users can log in using their credentials. The system ensures secure authentication.
Profile Management: Users can view and update their profile information.
Role-Based Access Control: The application differentiates between regular users and administrators. Administrators have additional privileges, such as access to the User Management dashboard.
User Status Management: Administrators can enable or disable user accounts.
User Role Management: Administrators can assign roles (user/admin) to different accounts.
Password Recovery: Users can reset their passwords if forgotten.
The project employs a clean and user-friendly interface with a focus on responsive design, ensuring a smooth experience across different devices.
